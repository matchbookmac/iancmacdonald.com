    complex really challenges me.</p>

    <p class="post">Today was a little better in the lifts. It was a snatch workout, and I
    really enjoy snatching, so things went a little better. I also really enjoy     back squats, which we did some volume work in. I also carved a pumpkin of
    to look like a guy snatching. I was quite proud of it.</p>
